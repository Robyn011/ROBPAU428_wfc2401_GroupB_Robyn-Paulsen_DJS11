## Description:
The app displays available shows with preview images and supports alphabetical sorting and genre filtering. Users can listen to episodes, view season-specific information, and navigate between seasons. Favorite episodes can be marked, grouped, and arranged, with the option to store them in localStorage. The app fetches show data from an API and shows loading states during data fetching. It also tracks listening progress, provides notifications for page closure with an active audio player, and offers a reset option for the listening history.

## Features that I to add in the future:
- Season View: Toggle to view episodes for a selected season.
- Season Navigation: Switch between different seasons of the same show.
- Season Information: Display the number of seasons for a show.
- Season Information: Display the number of seasons for a show.

- Episode Count: Show the number of episodes in a season.
- Back to Show View: Navigate back to the show view from a season-specific view.
